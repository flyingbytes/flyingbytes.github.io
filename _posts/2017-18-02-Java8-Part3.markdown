Hello everybody,

In the [last part][part2], we've learned about the Optional type and how to use it correctly. Today, we will learn about `Streams`, which you use as an functional alternative of working with Collections, Iterables and so on. 
Some method were already seen when we used Optionals. I won't explain them all in detail again, so be sure to check out [the part about Optionals][part2]

TODO reduce, joining, collector,...
TODO in part 0, 1, 2, jeweils referencen auf diesen part.

## Where do we use Streams?

You might ask what's wrong with the current way to store multiple objects? Why shouldn't you use Lists, Sets and so on anymore?

I want to point out: Nothing is wrong with them. But when you want to work functional (what you hopefully want after the last parts of this blog), you should consider using them. 
The standard workflow is to convert to transform your data structure into a Stream. Then you want to work on them in a functional manner and in the end, you transform them back into the data structure of your choice.

And that's the reason we will learn to transform the most common data structures into streams.

## How to Convert Data Structures into Streams

TODO Convert Array
TODO IntStream
### Converting Collections (Lists, Sets, ...)

Luckily, Oracle has thought through the implementation of Streams in Java 8. Every Class that implements [java.util.Collection<T>][javaDocCollection] has a new method called `stream()` which converts the collection into a Stream. It's as easy as it get's.

{% highlight java %}
public void convertStuff() {
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

    Stream<String> setStream = set.stream();
    Stream<Integer> listStream = list.stream();
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Converting Iterables
TODO Flatmap optionals part 2, auch in DZone ändern
The conversion of an Iterables into a Stream is a bit trickier. However, Oracle also introduced the `StreamSupport` class to help with them.

{% highlight java %}
public void convertStuff() {
    Iterables<String> iter = new Iterable<>();

    Stream<Integer> iterStream = StreamSupport.stream(iterable.spliterator(), false);
}
{% endhighlight %}
...

However, normally you won't store a Stream as an object. You just work with them and convert them back into your desired data structure.

## Working with Streams
As I already said, Streams are the way to work with data structures functional. And now we will learn about the most common methods to use.
In the next TODOAbschnitten, I will use T as the type of the objects in the Stream.

### Methods we already know
TODO Vergleiche mit OOP programming
You can use some methodes we already heard about when we learned about Optionals also with Streams.
#### map and flatMap
These work pretty straight forward. Instead of manipulating one item, which might be in the Optional, we manipulate all items in a stream

{% highlight java %}
public void showMap() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.of(1, 2, 3)

    numbers.stream()
        .map(num -> num * num)
        .forEach(System.out::println) // -> 1 4 9
}
{% endhighlight %}

TODO Flatmap

{% highlight java %}
public void showFlatMap() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.of(0, 1, 2, 3)

    numbers.stream()
        .flatMap(num -> divide(1, num))
        .filter(Optional::isPresent)
        .map(Optional::get) // TODO Sag dazu, dass man diese 2 Zeilen in Java 9 durch .flatMap(Optional::stream) ersetzen kann + Verweis talk 
        .forEach(System.out::println) // -> 1 4 9
}

public Optional<Integer> divide(Integer first, Integer second) {
    if(second == 0) {
       return Optional.empty();
    }

    return Optional.of(first / second);
}
{% endhighlight %}

And in these examples, we already TODOwitrklichsaw other Stream method, which I will describe now.

### Common Stream methods
TODO ist map mit side effects
TODO PArallelstreams

#### forEach
forEach is like map, but you use it when you have side effects. As already shown, you use it to e.g. print all object in a stream.

{% highlight java %}
public void showFilter() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.of(0, 1, 2, 3)

    numbers.stream()
        .forEach(System.out::println) // -> 0, 1, 2, 3
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### filter
Filter is a really basic method. It takes a 'test' function that takes a value and returns boolean. So it test every object in the Stream. If it passes the test, it will stay in the Stream or otherwise, it will be taken out. So this 'test' function has the type `Function<T, Boolean>`. In the [JavaDoc][streamJavaDoc], you will see that the test function really is of the type `Predicate<T>`. But this is just a short form for every function that takes one parameter and returns a boolean.


{% highlight java %}
public void showFilter() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.of(0, 1, 2, 3)

    numbers.stream()
        .filter(num -> num < 2)
        .forEach(System.out::println) // -> 0, 1
}
{% endhighlight %}

TODO Schreiben, dass stream() ursprünglcihen Datensatz **Nicht** verändert.

#### collect
As I already said, you want to transform your stream back into another data structure. And that is what you use Collect for. And most of the times, you convert it into a List or a Set.

{% highlight java %}
public void showCollect() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.of(0, 1, 2, 3)

    List<Integer> filtered = numbers.stream()
        .filter(num -> num < 2)
        .collect(Collectors.toList())
}
{% endhighlight %}

But you can use collect for much more. For example, you can join Strings. Therefore, you don't have the nasty delimeter in the end of the string.

{% highlight java %}
public void showReduceConcat() {
    List<Stream> words = Arrays.of("Who", "are", "you?")

    Stirng sentence = Stream.of("Who", "are", "you?")
        .collect(Collectors.joining(" "))

    System.out.println(sentence) --> Who are you ?

}
{% endhighlight %}

### Shortcuts

These are methods which you could emulate by using map, filter and collect, but these shortcut method are meant to be used because they declutter your code.

#### reduce
Reduce is a very cool function.
It takes a start parameter of type T and a Function of type `BiFunction<T, T, T>`. If you have a BiFunction, where all types are the same, `BinaryOperator<T>` is a shortcut for that. 
It basically stores all objects in the stream to one object. You can concat all Strings into one String, sum all Numbers and so on. There, your star parametrs would be the empty String or zero. This function helps a lot to make your code more readable if you know how to use it.

TODO Mehr dazu schreiben. Von welcher Seite wird reduziert, wozu start parameter
TODO Nicht Strings concaten, mach ich oben mit collect schon besser.

{% highlight java %}
public void showReduceConcat() {
    List<Stream> words = Arrays.of("Who", "are", "you?")

    Stirng sentence = numbers.stream()
        .reduce("", (acc, s) -> acc.concat(" ").concat(s))

    System.out.println(sentence) --> "Who are you ? "

}

public void showReduceSum() {

    Integer sum = Stream.of(0, 1, 2, 3) //TODO Das überall nutzen und einführen
        .reduce(0, Integer::sum)

    System.out.println(sum) --> 6
}
{% endhighlight %}

But as you can see, reduce produces a nasty space in the end of the String in this example. But good for us, there is also a method to help us with this

#### sort
You can also use Streams to sort your data structure. The class type of the objects in the Stream doesn't even have to implement `Comperable<T>`, because you can write your own `Comperator<T>`. This is basically a `BiFunction<T, T, int>`, but Comperator is a shortcut for all BiFunctions that take 2 arguments of the same type and return an int. And this int, like in the `compareTo()` function, shows us, if the first object is "smaller" than the first one (int < 0), is as big as the second (int == 0), or if it's bigger than the second one (int > 0). 

The sorted function of the Stream will interpret the int and will sort the elements by

public void showReduceSum() {

    Stream.of(0, 2, 1, 3) //TODO Das überall nutzen und einführen
        .reduce(0, Integer::sum)

    System.out.println(sum) --> 6
}

{% endhighlight %}
#### Example: Playing with Optionals
{% highlight java %}
public void playingWithOptionals() {
    String s = "Hello World!";
    String nullString = null;

    Optional<String> optionalS1 = Optional.of(s); // Will work
    Optional<String> optionalS2 = Optional.ofNullable(s); // Will work too
    Optional<String> optionalNull1 = Optional.of(nullString); // -> NullPointerException
    Optional<String> optionalNull2 = Optional.ofNullable(nullString); // Will work

    System.out.println(optionalS1.get()); // prints "Hello World!"
    System.out.println(optionalNull2.get()); // -> NoSuchElementException
    if(!optionalNull2.isPresent()) {
        System.out.println("Is empty"); // Will be printed
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Common problems when using Optionals

### 1. Working with Optional **and** null
{% highlight java %}
public void workWithFirstStringInDB() {
    DBConnection dB = new DBConnection();
    Optional<String> first = dB.getFirstString();

    if(first != null) {
        String value = first.get(); 
        //... 
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is just the wrong use of an Optional! If you get an Optional (In the example you get one from the DB), you don't have to look whether the object is null or not! If there's no string in the DB, it will return `Optional.empty()`, not `null`! If you got an empty Optional from the DB, there would also be a `NoSuchElementException` in this example.

### 2. Using isPresent() and get()

#### 2.1. Doing something when the value is present

{% highlight java %}
public void workWithFirstStringInDB() {
    DBConnection dB = new DBConnection();
    Optional<String> first = dB.getFirstString();

    if(first.isPresent()) {
        String value = first.get(); 
        //... 
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As I already said, you should always be 100% sure if an Optional is present before you use `Optional.get()`. You wouldn't get a `NoSuchElementException` anymore in the updated function. But you shouldn't check a optional with the `isPresent() + get()` combo! Because if you do it like that, you could have used *null* in the first place. You would replace `first.isPresent()` with `first != null` and you have the same result. But how can we replace this annoying if-block with the help of Optionals?

{% highlight java %}
public void workWithFirstStringInDB() {
    DBConnection dB = new DBConnection();
    Optional<String> first = dB.getFirstString();

    first.ifPresent(value -> /*...*/);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `Optional.ifPresent()` method is our new best friend to replace the if. It takes a Function, so a Lambda or method reference, and applies it only when the value is present. If you don't remember how to use method references or Lambdas, you should read the [last part][part1] of this series again.

#### 2.2. Returning a Modified Version of the Value

{% highlight java %}
public Integer doubleValueOrZero(Optional<Integer> value) {
    if(value.isPresent()) {
       return value.get() * 2;
    }

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this method, we want to double the value of an optional, if it is present. Otherwise, we return zero. The given example works, but it isn't the functional way of solving this problem.
To make this a lot nicer, we have two function that are coming to help us. 
The first one's `Optional.map(Function<T, R> mapper)` and the second one's `Optional.orElse(T other)`.
`map` takes a function, applies it on the value and returns the result of the function, wrapped in an Optional again. If the Optional is empty, it will return an empty Optional again.
`orElse` returns the value of the Optional it is called on. If there is no value, it returns the value you gave `orElse(object)` as a parameter.
With that in mind, we can make this function a one liner.

{% highlight java %}
public Integer doubleValueOrZero(Optional<Integer> value) {
    return value.map(i -> i * 2).orElse(0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## When Should you use Nullable Objects and when Optionals
You can find a lot of books, [talks][optionalTalks] and discussions about the question: Should you use null or Optional in some particular case. And both have their right to be used. 
In the linked talk, you will find a nice rule which you can apply in most of the cases. Use Optionals when *"there is a clear need to represent 'no result' or where null is likely to cause errors."*.

So you shouldn't use Optionals like this:

{% highlight java %}
public String defaultIfOptional(String string) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(string).orElse("default");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Because a null check is much easier to read.

{% highlight java %}
public String defaultIfOptional(String string) {
    return (string != null) ? string : "default";
}
{% endhighlight %}

You should use Optionals just as a return value from a function. It's not a good idea to create new ones to make a cool method chain like in the example above. Most of the times, null is enough.

## Conclusion
TODO Falls Methoden für Streams fehlen, lasst es mich gerne wissen
TODO Was in nächsten part? RxJava?
That's it for today!
We have played with the Optional class. It's a container class for other classes which is either present or not present(*empty*). We have removed some common code smell that comes with Optionals and used functions as objects again. We also discussed when you should use null and when Optionals.

In the next part, we will use *Streams* as a new way to handle a Collection of Objects, like Iterables and Collections.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day,

Niklas
