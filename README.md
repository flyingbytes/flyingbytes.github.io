# Welcome to my Blog!

My name is Niklas and I'm an Android developer from Germany. I love to program, mainly in Kotlin.

I'm creating this blog to write about interesting things I found out about Java and about all the computer stuff that bothers me. As I'm a big fan of functional programming, most of my posts will be about Java and Kotlin in the light of functional programming. For some examples, this is done in the context of Android app development.
If you are fascinated by programming, then please join the discussion in the comment section! I'm really interested in hearing your opinion.  

Have a nice day and I hope to hear you soon!
