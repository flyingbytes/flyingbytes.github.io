# Welcome to my Blog!

My name is Niklas and I'm a computer science student from Germany. I love to program, mainly in Java.

I'm creating this blog to write about interesting things I found out about Java and about all the computer stuff that bothers me. As I'm a big fan of functional programming, most of my posts will be about Java 8 and its new functional features.
If you are fascinated by programming, then please join the discussion in the comment section! I'm really interested in hearing your opinion.
Have a nice day and I hope to hear you soon!
